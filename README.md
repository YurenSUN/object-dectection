# object-dectection

Object detection ios application adapted from tflite example at https://github.com/tensorflow/examples/blob/master/lite/examples/object_detection/ios


The models and build are not included due to their sizes. The project could be build and run in the same process as the above object detection example after copying the models and label txt files (from FashionNet Dataset) to the ObjectDetection/TFLite folder. Possible renaming of the models and/or changing/adding paths in ModelTypeAttribute enumerator in ObjectDetection/ViewControllers/ViewController.swift are be required.
